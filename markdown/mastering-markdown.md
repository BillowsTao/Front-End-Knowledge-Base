## What is Markdown?

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

- [Gists](https://gist.github.com/)
- Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension

For more information, see “[Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/)” in the GitHub Help.

## Examples

### Text

### Lists

```markdown
Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this
```

### Images

```markdown
If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

![Image of Yaktocat](./resource/yaktocat.png)
```
