AngularJS expressions are JavaScript-like code snippets that are mainly placed in interpolation bindings such as `<span title="{{ attrBinding }}">{{ textBinding }}</span>`, but also used directly in directive attributes such as `ng-click="functionExpression()"`.

For example, these are valid expressions in AngularJS:

- `1+2`
- `a+b`
- `user.name`
- `items[index]`

## AngularJS Expressions vs. JavaScript Expressions

AngularJS expressions are like JavaScript expressions with the following differences:

- **Context:** JavaScript expressions are evaluated against the global `window`. In AngularJS, expressions are evaluated against a `scope` object.
- **Forgiving:** In JavaScript, trying to evaluate `undefined` properties generates `ReferenceError` or `TypeError`. In AngularJS, expression evaluation is forgiving to `undefined` and `null`.
- **Filters:** You can use filters within expressions to format data before displaying it.
- **No Control Flow Statements:** You cannot use the following in an AngularJS expression: conditionals, loops, or exceptions.
- **No Function Declarations:** You cannot declare functions in an AngularJS expression, even inside `ng-init` directive.
- **No RegExp Creation With Literal Notation:** You cannot create regular expressions in an AngularJS expression. An exception to this rule `is ng-pattern` which accepts valid RegExp.
- **No Object Creation With New Operator:** You cannot use `new` operator in an AngularJS expression.
- **No Bitwise, Comma, And Void Operators:** You cannot use `Bitwise`, `,` or `void` operators in an AngularJS expression.

## Example

`index.html`

```html
<span>
  1+2={{1+2}}
</span>
```

You can try evaluating different expressions here:

`index.html`

```html
<div ng-controller="ExampleController" class="expressions">
  Expression:
  <input type='text' ng-model="expr" size="80"/>
  <button ng-click="addExp(expr)">Evaluate</button>
  <ul>
   <li ng-repeat="expr in exprs track by $index">
     [ <a href="" ng-click="removeExp($index)">X</a> ]
     <code>{{expr}}</code> => <span ng-bind="$parent.$eval(expr)"></span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

`script.js`

```js
angular.module('expressionExample', [])
.controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
  var exprs = $scope.exprs = [];
  $scope.expr = '3*10|currency';
  $scope.addExp = function(expr) {
    exprs.push(expr);
  };

  $scope.removeExp = function(index) {
    exprs.splice(index, 1);
  };
}]);
```

## Context

AngularJS does not use JavaScript's `eval()` to evaluate expressions. Instead AngularJS's `$parse` service processes these expressions.

AngularJS expressions do not have direct access to global variables like `window`, `document` or `location`. This restriction is intentional. It prevents accidental access to the global state â€“ a common source of subtle bugs.

Instead use services like `$window` and `$location` in functions on controllers, which are then called from expressions. Such services provide mockable access to globals.

It is possible to access the context object using the identifier `this` and the locals object using the identifier `$locals`.

`index.html`

```html
<div class="example2" ng-controller="ExampleController">
  Name: <input ng-model="name" type="text"/>
  <button ng-click="greet()">Greet</button>
  <button ng-click="window.alert('Should not see me')">Won't greet</button>
</div>
```

`script.js`

```js
angular.module('expressionExample', [])
.controller('ExampleController', ['$window', '$scope', function($window, $scope) {
  $scope.name = 'World';

  $scope.greet = function() {
    $window.alert('Hello ' + $scope.name);
  };
}]);
```

## Forgiving

Expression evaluation is forgiving to `undefined` and `null`. In JavaScript, evaluating `a.b.c` throws an exception if `a` is not an object. While this makes sense for a general purpose language, the expression evaluations are primarily used for data binding, which often look like this:

`{{a.b.c}}`

It makes more sense to show nothing than to throw an exception if a is `undefined` (perhaps we are waiting for the server response, and it will become defined soon). If expression evaluation wasn't forgiving we'd have to write bindings that clutter the code, for example: `{{((a||{}).b||{}).c}}`

Similarly, invoking a function `a.b.c()` on `undefined` or `null` simply returns `undefined`.
